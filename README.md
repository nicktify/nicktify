I am a proactive Full Stack Developer with a strong passion for continuous learning. Currently employed at Capta Hydro, I specialize in constructing cloud solutions on AWS and contributing to the company's growth through the development of robust and scalable software solutions.

My academic background initially led me to pursue law studies at university in 2019. However, I discovered my true calling lay in software development. Transitioning into this field in late 2020, I embarked on a self-taught journey, harnessing a variety of online learning platforms such as Coursera, edX, Harvard's CS50 MOOC, and Udemy courses. One pivotal resource that significantly shaped my foundational knowledge was the book 'Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach' by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. This resource offered me a comprehensive understanding of core computer science principles, propelling my growth as a developer.
